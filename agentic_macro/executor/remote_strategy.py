# Do not edit here. This is a copy, per that file's own deployment note ("copy the
# client/ directory onto the box running your strategy"). To pick up executor-side
# changes, re-copy both files and re-run the tests — they pin the request shapes
# this sleeve depends on, so a drifted copy fails loudly rather than at submit time.

"""
client/remote_strategy.py — the shape of a strategy that runs off the executor's host.

Subclass RemoteStrategy, implement `generate_book`, and the framework does the rest: the
preflight, the capital lookup, book validation, submission, the journal entry, and the exit
codes your scheduler reads.

    class MyStrategy(RemoteStrategy):
        strategy_id = "my_strategy"

        def generate_book(self, capital):
            return [self.intent("AAPL", 78, 319.97)]

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        raise SystemExit(MyStrategy.cli())

Everything the framework does is something that is easy to get wrong once and never notice:

  * `preflight()` before any work, so a broken executor fails before a half-book exists;
  * capital read from the executor, so the strategy follows /allocate instead of a constant
    someone has to remember to edit;
  * every book VALIDATED before it is sent — most importantly that `expected_price` is a
    real, positive, finite number, because the executor values your book with it when it
    applies the allocation cap. A stale or missing price mis-sizes the order AND the limit
    meant to contain it;
  * submission through `/targets` (absolute, authoritative, safe to repeat);
  * a journal entry on EVERY run, including the ones that decide to do nothing — those are
    the runs you cannot reconstruct later;
  * exit codes: 0 submitted or deliberately skipped, 1 refused, 2 unreachable.
